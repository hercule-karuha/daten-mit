Discussion Question 1 (5 Points): What is the IPC for the two-stage pipelined processor 
for each benchmark tested by the run_bmarks.sh script?

OUTPUT:

Benchmark median
Cycles = 11016
Insts  = 4243
IPC = 0.385

Benchmark multiply
Cycles = 60129
Insts  = 20893
IPC = 0.347

Benchmark qsort
Cycles = 314313
Insts  = 123496
IPC = 0.392

Benchmark tower
Cycles = 8078
Insts  = 3743
IPC = 0.463

Benchmark vvadd
Cycles = 5711
Insts  = 2408
IPC = 0.421

Discussion Question 2 (5 Points): What is the formula to compute the next address predictor accuracy from the IPC? 
(Hint, how many cycles does it take to execute an instruction when the PC+4 prediction is correct? 
What about when it is incorrect?) 
Using this formula, what is the accuracy of the PC+4 next address predictor for each benchmark?

formula: predictor_accuracy = (2 * ipc -1) / ipc
