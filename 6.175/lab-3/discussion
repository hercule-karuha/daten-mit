Discussion Question 1:
What is the source of the performance gap between your two elastic implementations 
(when it is using the class fifo and when it is using your own fifo)?

my fifo: 260 cycles
class fifo: 193 cycles

because my fifo is not enough concurrency

Discussion Question 2:
Assume you are given a black box module that performs a 10-stage algorithm. 
You can not look at its internal implementation, 
but you can test this module by giving it data and looking at the output of the module. 
You have been told that it is implemented as one of the structures covered in this lab, but you do not know which one. 
How can you tell if it is inelastic or if it is elastic?


Continuously providing input without processing output, observe if it leads to the inability to continue inputting. 
Elastic pipelines can accommodate more input.
