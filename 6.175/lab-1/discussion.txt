How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
4 4 * 5 = 20 

Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
5 * 8 = 40

Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
8A, 4A + M

Optional: How long did you take to work on this lab?
